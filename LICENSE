"Documentation" means written or electronic documentation provided with the Licensed Software, including user guides, installation guides, administrator guides, README files, release notes, and other manuals or help text.

2. Grant of License

Subject to the terms and conditions below and to full payment of any applicable fees under a separate License Agreement between you (the "Licensee") and Purple Data Inc. (the "Licensor"), Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to:
  - Use, reproduce, and run the Licensed Software for Licensee's internal business purposes;
  - Use the Documentation for Licensee's internal business purposes and to operate, install, configure, or administer the Licensed Software as permitted by this Agreement;
  - Distribute objects/binaries derived from the Licensed Software as permitted by a separate written distribution agreement.

3. Documentation and Guides

3.1 Documentation Included. The parties agree that Documentation (including user guides and installation guides) are part of the Licensed Software and are proprietary to Licensor.

3.2 Use of Documentation. Licensee may use Documentation for internal use, installation, configuration, operation, training, and support of the Licensed Software. Licensee may make reasonable internal copies for these purposes.

3.3 Restrictions on Documentation Redistribution. Unless expressly permitted by a separate written agreement with Licensor, Licensee shall not:

3.4 Permitted Documentation Distribution. Licensor may, in its sole discretion and under a separate written distribution or partner agreement, permit Licensee to distribute specific Documentation to customers, partners, or end users (for example, as part of an authorized installation package).
