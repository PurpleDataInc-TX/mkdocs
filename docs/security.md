Security is a paramount concern when it comes to managing and optimizing your cloud 
environments. CloudPi is designed with stringent security measures to ensure that your data 
remains safe and your operations stay secure.
## Access Requirements
CloudPi requires read-only access to your cloud service accounts. This minimal access level 
ensures that CloudPi can gather necessary billing and service data without the ability to 
modify any aspect of your environment. Here’s what you need to know about our access 
requirements:

- Read-Only Access: By limiting access to read-only, CloudPi ensures that it can 
perform necessary analytics and monitoring without the risk of altering your cloud 
setup. This access allows CloudPi to retrieve data related to usage, costs, inventory 
and configurations.

- Billing and Service Account Roles: Specific roles need to be configured within your 
cloud provider to grant CloudPi the necessary permissions. These roles should only 
encompass capabilities that allow data viewing and not data modification.

## Addressing Security Concerns
We understand the importance of security for our customers. Here are the steps we take to 
safeguard your information:
- Data Encryption: All data, both in transit and at rest, is encrypted using industry standard encryption protocols. This ensures that your data is protected from 
unauthorized access.
- Compliance and Certifications: CloudPi complies with major industry standards and 
regulations to ensure that we meet the highest security benchmarks.
- Regular Security Audits: Our systems undergo regular security audits to identify and 
rectify any vulnerabilities, ensuring that our defenses remain robust against 
emerging threats.
- Transparent Privacy Policies: We are committed to transparency regarding how we 
handle your data. Our privacy policies clearly outline how data is collected, used, and 
protected.

## How to Grant Access
To set up CloudPi, follow these steps to grant read-only access securely:
- Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) section of your cloud 
provider.
- Create a new role specifically for CloudPi with predefined policies that restrict 
permissions to read-only access.
- Assign this role to CloudPi during the setup process by providing the necessary 
credentials through a secure, encrypted session.
