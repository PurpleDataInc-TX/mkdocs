# Alerts and Notifications

## Overview
CloudPi alerts notify teams about policy findings, budget thresholds, and workflow events. Notifications can be routed to email or ticketing systems.

## Alert Types
- **Policy alerts** based on rule triggers
- **Budget alerts** for threshold breaches
- **Workflow alerts** for task or ticket status changes

## Notification Channels
- Email via SMTP
- Tickets via Jira, ServiceNow, or Azure DevOps

## Configuration
1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings**.
2. Enable alert types and choose notification channels.
3. Test alerts with a pilot rule or threshold.

## Best Practices
- Use dedicated distribution lists for email alerts.
- Route high-severity findings to ticketing systems.
- Review alert rules quarterly to reduce noise.
