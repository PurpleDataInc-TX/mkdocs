## Managing Workspace Roles and Access
## Overview
Effective management of workspace roles and access is critical in CloudPi to ensure that 
team members have the appropriate permissions for their roles, enhancing security and 
efficiency. This feature allows administrators to customize access levels for different roles 
such as project admins, cost analysts, and finance team members.
## Key Features for Managing Roles and Access
### Role Definition and Management

within the workspace, controlling who can view, edit, or manage specific aspects of the 
cloud environment.
- **Role Assignment:** Assign roles carefully to ensure that individuals have the necessary 
permissions to perform their tasks effectively without compromising security.

***Regular Access Review:***

they align with current project scopes and personnel changes. This helps maintain security 
integrity and operational efficiency.

***Navigating Roles and Access***

you can assign or modify roles.
- **Audit and Adjust:** Use the audit log to review changes and access patterns, making 
adjustments as needed to keep the workspace secure and functional.


Roles are set to define the access level or permissions a user has within the platform. 
Common roles include "Workspace User," "Project Admin," and "Project User." 

- **Workspace User:** Generally has permissions to manage project-specific settings 
within their assigned workspace, integrate with third-party tools, and manage 
optimization and alert settings.
- **Project Admin:** Responsible for managing project-level settings that directly affect 
the resources and cost management of their specific projects.
- **Project User:** Has a more focused set of permissions suitable for managing specific 
aspects of a project, typically without having full administrative rights.
