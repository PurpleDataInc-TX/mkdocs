# Global Policies

## Overview

The **Global Policies** section provides centralized location where all predefined policies across AWS, Azure, and GCP are listed and managed.

## What You'll Find

- Comprehensive list of built-in policies
- Categorized by cloud provider
- Policy metadata (name, classification, description)

## Controlling Policy Behavior

From Global Policies page, decide how each policy behaves:

**Mandatory:** Enforced by default, cannot be overridden at project level

**Optional:** Available for project-level adoption but not enforced

This flexibility balances organization-wide controls with project-level customization.

## Policy Categories

- **Cost:** Cost optimization and budget control
- **Security:** Security compliance and best practices
- **Performance:** Resource performance optimization
- **Compliance:** Regulatory compliance checks
