# Project Groups

## What is a Project Group?

A **Project Group** represents a set of projects organized together to mirror a department or business unit within your organization. This feature allows you to introduce your business terminology into CloudPi cost and optimization strategies, making it more intuitive and relevant to your operations.

## Purpose

Project Groups help you:
- **Mirror organizational structure** in CloudPi
- **Aggregate costs** across related projects
- **Generate consolidated reports** for business units
- **Assign group-level budgets** and track spending
- **Delegate management** to department heads

## Structure Example

```
Project Group: Engineering Department
├── Project: AWS Production
├── Project: AWS Development  
├── Project: Azure Production
└── Project: GCP Testing
```

## Creating Project Groups

1. Navigate to **Cost Assignment**
2. Click **Create Project Group**
3. Enter:
   - **Group Name** (e.g., "Engineering", "Marketing")
   - **Description**
   - **Owner/Manager**
4. Click **Save**
