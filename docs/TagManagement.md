Tag Management is one of the features offered by CloudPi. It allows you to add labels to 
your cloud resources/services data, making it easier to organize and manage them 
effectively.

### Why Tagging is Important?
Tagging is an important activity as it brings integrity and dimension to your cloud 
resources/services data. It helps you:

- Organize: Group similar resources together for easy identification and management.

- Track Costs: Monitor expenses associated with specific projects or departments.
Control Access: Set permissions and access levels based on resource tags.

- Optimize Usage: Identify underutilized or unused resources for potential cost savings.

## Tag Management Key Features
In CloudPi, we empower users to tag their resources using two methods:

- Auto Tagging: This feature allows you to automatically assign tags based on project names.

- User Defined Tagging: Alternatively, you can also add your own tags and business 
terminology to categorize your resources.

environment!
