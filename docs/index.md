## Understanding Workspaces
Use workspaces for your organization when you want to structure your teams and entities, 
encourage team collaboration, and have organization-wide views. Each workspace ensures 
that data is kept separate and secure. A workspace can represent an entire organization or a 
8
specific Line of Business with multiple teams and departments. It can also be a collection of 
applications or divisions serving different clients.
In Workspace settings, setup third party workflow tools like Jira and ServiceNow. 
Workspace Admin can add/delete workspace users and other users, can assign roles.
Workspace Users get access to Executive level reports or customized reports across the 
[projects](http://cloudpie.ai:3000/) or [project groups](http://cloudpie.ai:3000/).

## Understanding Projects
A 'project' in CloudPi is a logical grouping of cloud resources based on the cloud provider 
account and/or tags. Essentially, project is for a team to focus on analyzing various cloud 
resources data such as billing data, inventory data, usage and utilization data, savings plans 
data, optimizations based on resource utilization and much more. Within each project, 
reports are generated catering to personas including Cloud Ops managers and Engineers.
When to use Projects?
A Project is used typically to focus on one cloud Service Provider with an account to 
generate and make one team responsible for managing cloud billing and optimizations.
A CloudPi Project is used for one Cloud Service Provider with multiple sub accounts or 
resource groups to see combined billing reports for different personas.
A CloudPi Project is configured for managing cloud costs and management per 
‘Environment’
A CloudPi Project is used for product resources in one cloud provider.
A CloudPi Project is used per customer basis.

business unit within your organization. This feature allows you to introduce your business
