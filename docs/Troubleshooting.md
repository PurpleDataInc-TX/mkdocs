# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### No data after onboarding
- Confirm the export is active and delivering files.
- Verify CloudPi has read access to the export location.
- Allow time for first ingestion (provider latency varies).

### Missing tags or labels
- Ensure cost allocation tags are activated in the cloud provider.
- Confirm exports include resource IDs.

### Integration status shows error
- Recheck credentials, role permissions, and scope.
- Validate account IDs, tenant IDs, and project IDs.

### SSO login issues
- Verify SSO metadata values and certificate validity.
- Confirm the user email matches CloudPi user records.
